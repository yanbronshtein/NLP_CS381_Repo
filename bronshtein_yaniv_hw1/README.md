# HW1 by Yaniv Bronshtein

## To run this assignment, go to the terminal and type:
python3 hw1.py

## User input
You will be prompted to enter a directory containing the two text source files "train.txt" and "test.txt"
You must enter the full path to the location of the two files and they must be in the same directory
If this is in the current directory, just type:
pwd
The output will give the desired string

The rest is self explanatory
